# Fitmint Guide Contracts

This is the part of https://github.com/sergeevpasha/fitmint-guide project. 
You can check live version on https://fitmint.guide

## Local Development

I moved local network to a separate image (you can check .docker folder for source code).
So now you can simply run `make up` and will get 2 running containers. This allows you to connect MetaMask to the running node.

If you want to practice web3 you are welcome to add more tests to this repository and submit a PR.
